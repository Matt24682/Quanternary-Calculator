##Meetings
###Unfortunately due to varying class and work schedules, we were unable to meet for a full team meeting. We also did not meet up with parts of the group.
###While not being able to meet was an inconvenience, we did our best to keep continuous communication via the group chat created for this assignment in Slack. We would inform each other of what we were planning to work on, along with the progress each of us had made as we worked on different parts as to prevent multiple people from working on the same part (unless assistance was needed).
